\section{Conclusion}

By noticing patterns in math through a geometric lens and applying them across dimensions, we reveal underlying properties that unify ideas which seem unrelated. We recapped how conic sections are created from intersecting a plane with a 3D cone at varying angles, which produces circles, ellipses, parabolas, and hyperbolas. Once we extended this idea into the 4th dimension we can see that all quadric surfaces are related to the cross sections of a 4D hyper cone. The type of quadric surface obtained is dependent on the orientation and position of of the intersecting hyperplane. This is the direct 3D equivalent of eccentricity found in conic sections.
